# Intelligent Urban Traffic Signalization System using Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Gradients.

This code is inspired from <a href="https://github.com/philtabor/Multi-Agent-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradients"> Phil Tabor's Implementaion</a> on <a href="https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs">Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Gradients by OpenAI</a>.

The traffic environment's geographic setting was taken from OpenStreetMap and is modified to represent the concurrent traffic scheme as of 2023. The traffic data was collected through real-time on-site surveys done by students from Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan overseen by @Nins.

The main objective of this code is to develop an algorithm that utilizes Artifical Intelligence to thoroughly optimize the traffic light signalization in Cagayan de Oro's Poblacion area through the MADDPG Algorithm.
